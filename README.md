# Fit-Algorithms-in-Operating-Systems
This repo includes all codes for the OS program that calculates with a given algorithm (First, Best and Worst).

How to run this script:
You have to run cmd (or powershell) in the folder where source codes are downloaded.
Run the main code in that command line with a python (version should be higher than 3.0)


# PROJECT DESCRIPTON
1) After you run the command python main.py, It will give you a welcome message and asks you to select Operating System Size
2) Select your desired algorithm (Lowercase or uppercase does not matter)
  Example #1: Invalid Input Example for Selection of Algorithm

3) After you adjusted bases of your OS, it will go to main menu. In that menu, there are 6 different options:
  1)Display the OS Space
      It gives you a current situtation of OS.

  2)Add a program
      It provides user to add a new program into location that is determined by the choosen algorithm. If there is no possible location, the system will recommend you to do compaction (option 4).
      Example of adding a new program:
![C__Windows_System32_cmd exe - python  main py 2022-08-30 21-46-08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61635625/187523751-453b0d80-9624-4a42-874b-4938a8fc05ff.gif)
  3)Remove a program
  4)Compaction
  5)Clear all programs
  6)Quit the Program
